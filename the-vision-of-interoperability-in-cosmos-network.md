Imagine a world where people living across continents can talk to each other without linguistic limitations. Humans would be able to communicate with maximum efficiency. Multinational teams would be able to interoperate and achieve synergetic effect. There are two possible scenarios that make it theoretically possible.

The first one presumes the existence of a single global language adopted by everyone. In this case there are huge difficulties. National cultures across the continents are very different, generations have created their own traditions and beliefs over the centuries. Local languages influence the thinking of each individual. The existence of a single language means blurring the borders between nations and currently seems unrealistic.

Another way of thinking about it is to have a technology or device that automatically translates and transforms speech and allows people speaking different languages to understand each other without the need to learn another tongue. With this idea, for example,  anyone could speak English in China and be understood. The first steps in this area have been taken by Google and their[ Translatotron](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/introducing-translatotron-end-to-end.html) can serve as a starting point for a model that can translate speech from one language directly into another.

# **The vision of interoperable ecosystem for blockchains**

In the blockchain space there are also interoperability problems but soon a technology will allow different blockchains to understand each other. Various blockchains serve various purposes and may not be suitable for some uses. The ability to utilize features of each other and achieve synergetic effect may bring a new wave of development in crypto space.

Cosmos ecosystem is a "place" where all networks are connected to each other through a set of inter-chain standards (ICS). Communication is carried via inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) that requires specific modules that run on independent machines. Specific blockchains called hubs play a role of translators and make it possible to perform state transfer including tokens, ID metadata or even validator's set.

Construction of such application-specific blockchains from scratch is possible in a plug-in-play manner. Cosmos SDK provides a framework for simplification of the development process and makes it much more flexible. It is possible to choose from default modules that together define the actual state machine and customize sovereignty level. Each blockchain may have its own set of rules, validators and governance procedure to experiment with various incentive models without the need to conflict with a single set of governance rules.

Freedom is a key to innovation. Innovation is a key to a breakthrough. Cosmos network creates a healthy environment for developers and entrepreneurs who are seeking new ways of making value transactions to end-users and offers better means of cooperation by utilizing features of the whole set of projects in the ecosystem.
