Staking is always coupled with some sort of risk. Delegation process in most cases is not a simple process and one of possible dangers lies in the need to store your tokens with a third party providers in order to improve your staking experience. Fundamental rule says: your keys - your crypto. When you hold your keys you control the risk, when you use third parties in order to simplify delegation process, you transfer the risk on their behalf.
