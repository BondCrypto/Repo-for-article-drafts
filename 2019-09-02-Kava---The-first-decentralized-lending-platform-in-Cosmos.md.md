We live in the world of finance. Monetary incentives and market movements influence our daily decisions and define human lives in general. Under capitalism, financial industry became global expressing economic relations between people and institutions. Nowadays, existing wealth distribution mechanisms are inefficient, economic environment is unstable. *Trust becomes inevitable and we are moving into the new era of decentralized finance (DeFi).* Borderless, accessible and transparent interactions between participants without counterparties to transform(substitute) old and inefficient financial instruments in(with) the new paradigm of trustless economy.   

Kava is the first decentralized bank in the Cosmos ecosystem bridging broad digital assets to DeFi. With interoperability in mind and solid team cross-chain expertise Kava blockchain will bring new markets to the Cosmos ecosystem providing users with the liquidity and necessary fundament (building block) for DeFi applications and services.

# 4 "De" of Kava

**1) De-centralized lending solution.** Any person can take a loan in a stablecoin collateralized with crypto assets. There is no 3d party involved and each person is self-responsible for managing debt and lends to himself. This allows people to release a portion of stacked liquidity from passively held digital assets and spend it on whatever they want.

**2) De-centralized margin trading.** When users put crypto collateral to take a loan they can use it for doubling-down their long position in a particular asset. In this case, if collateral value of the asset increases user may get higher profit.

**3) De-centralized stablecoin.** Kava platform provides mechanism to issue a stable digital currency through collateralized debt position (CDP). Stable digital currency maintains `1:1 peg` to `USD` playing role of a hedge against bear market or a true mean of exchange without explicit volatility. It allows decentralized stablecoin to take part in a broaden financial applications like decentralized exchanges and financial marketplaces, creating wide space for DeFi development.

**4) De-centralized governance and ownership.** The most exciting part that everyone can participate in the project evolution and own a share of the network. All participants who stake native token `KAVA` rewarded for effective governance pretending on transaction fees, portion of a total supply emission and repaid loan fees. 

Cosmos ecosystem is designed with existing assets like Bitcoin or Ripple in mind. If we assume, that just `1%` of `BTC` will take part in DeFi it will result in more than `1,5 billion USD` value injection also adding to a scarcity to `BTC` positively influencing cryptocurrency market in general.
