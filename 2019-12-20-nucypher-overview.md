NuCypher is a decentralized secret management network where a group of nodes (validators) perform proxy re-encryption to manage permissions on encrypted data instead of a centralized server. It allows safe data exchange without ability for proxies to learn the plain text info. Correctness of validator behavior is guaranteed by staking. Additional token emission incentivizes node operators to maintain highly available infrastructure and in case of network rules violation portion of their holdings will be slashed. 

### Current state and market potential

Incentivized testnet "Come And Stake It" is ongoing and P2P Validator is participating amongst other 400 node operators distributing 1% of initial NU token supply as a reward to participants. NuCypher team plans to launch on mainnet soon after the event , which can end in the end of the February 2020.

Privacy of sensitive data is a vexed problem and services provided by NuCypher project are attractive and valuable not only in crypto space. The highest growth of [data breaches in USA](https://www.statista.com/statistics/798564/number-of-us-residents-affected-by-data-breaches/) was in healthcare sector demonstrating 80% increase from 2017 to 2019 including transmitting confidential data without proper encryption. 

Enterprises also are seeking the way to avoid data leaks securely manage and share sensitive data. [The Global Key Management as a Service Market](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/key-management-service-market-8188) market size is expected to grow from $363 million in 2018 to 1,28 billion by 2023 and estimated to reach $2,29 billion by 2025 during the period 2019–2025.

### Token allocation

In the firs round Nucypher raised $750k in 2016 ; $4.3 million in 2017 and $10,7 million in 2018. The overall token allocation looks as follows: (где incentivized testnet 6 month, Worklock тоже скорее всего. 4 столбец включать не нужно)

### Staking economics

In order to participate in the network as a worker and perform re-encryption node operators have to lock NU tokens. At the beginning rewards from providing re-encryptions might be low so until the project will get traction node operators will be incentivized mostly by minting of new tokens. Holders can delegate their funds increasing overall security of the network and earn a share of rewards in proportion to their stake.

To get maximum compensation from minting stakers have to lock their funds at least for a year showing the long term intention to support the network. Shorter commitment will result in lower rewards for participants. Staking since the beginning with compounding of rewards also will result in higher returns. The whole stake can be split on sub-stakes where each will have own lock-up period and reward conditions.

We believe in future adoption of NuCypher and will stake for long term maximizing staking rewards.

- Annual staking return - ~80% ... 160%*
- Lock-Up & Unbonding - 1 month ... 1 year+
- Reward re-investment - automatically by default, can be cancelled. If turned on rewards are locked.
- Redelegation - once in 2 periods
- Reward frequency - once in a period (~1 day) with 2 period delay of the first reward

*Depend on the length of lock-up and % of tokens staked.

### Native token

NuCypher token NU is ERC20 token which main purpose to act as a staking token in the network with limited liquidity and low volatility. Quantity of provided re-encryption will be higher for node operators with higher stake as it presumes higher loss in case of bad behavior. 

NuCypher based on Ethereum blockchain meaning that user should have ETH on the address to pay tx fees. Workers are also share service fees in ETH for providing re-encryptions.

To acquire NU you can participate in [WorkLock token distribution model](https://blog.nucypher.com/the-worklock/) proposed by NuCypher team.

### Slashing risks

This part is currently under research and exact parameters of slashing conditions are unknown. If there are many sub-stakes and misbehavior occurs the first affected portion of stake will be slashed for unlocked tokens which do not participate in staking and then ascending sub-stakes with lower lock-ups. 

### About P2P Validator
