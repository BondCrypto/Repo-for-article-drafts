Всем привет друзья, всех люблю!

2019 was a year saturated with amazing meaningful occasions(events) for staking ecosystem (or better to say in staking space?). It was marked by the launch of [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/), [Terra money](https://terra.money/), [IRIS network](https://www.irisnet.org/), [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/), [Kusama network](https://kusama.network/), [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) and many other Proof-Of-Stake based blockchains on mainnet.

We watched lots of development activities across various systems, solid projects with high potential of finding market fit launched incentivized testnets. [Solana](https://solana.com/) and [Celo](https://celo.org/) are amongst them.

We participated in every on-chain governance in [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), Cosmos Hub and IRIS network and it was a great feeling of true collaboration between stakeholders who are really interested in the best possible future for the ecosystem.

In 2019 [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmonauts.world/) grew to over 100 projects and [Tezos ecosystem](https://tezosprojects.com/) attracted over 1000 developers to facilitate continuous bulding. The Proof-Of-Stake space is still highly experimental and we are excited to be in front of the move to fair and efficient future.

# P2P Validator vision

Since the January 1st of 2019 asset value locked in staking increased nine times and [reached $6,5B](https://www.stakingrewards.com/global-charts). We are absolutely confident that Proof-Of-Stake ecosystem will continue to grow. With that in mind, P2P Validator will continue to extend communities of enthusiasts and developers, educate them about staking and various opportunities to create and learn from novel business models across the networks we support.

We will also focus on **making staking as simple, secure and attractive as possible**. Every project have it's own risk profile and our take here is that staking will add up to the value and to the network security only if the risk of losing funds for delegators is minimized and intention to put skin in the game is higher  than fear of losing it. Using exchanges as a staking provider results in additional risks. **For us being a reliable validator is a core(key) business activity**, while exchanges focus mostly on trading and other financial operations. 

Non-custodial staking allows every user to be in control of the assets eliminating risks associated with third parties, representing the safest way of participating in the ecosystem, especially for whales. Our goal is to simplify the interactions with hardware wallets by UI and be competitive in terms of various complementing services.

As of today, we provide validation services for ten networks including testnets and plan to join and support more groundbreaking projects that have competitive advantages and clear go to market strategy. The process of making decision about joining the network is complex as our resources and ability to add sufficient value are limited. We are closely watching the development of [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/), [NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/), [Telegram Open Network](https://test.ton.org/tblkch.pdf), [Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network/), and projects emerging in the Cosmos ecosystem. We also joined [Chainlink](https://chain.link) as a node operator to improve decentralization of an oracle network and solve the lack of real-world data for smart-contracts.

# Our achievements

We started as a small bakery in Tezos with only 2M USD value delegated with us and most of it were our own funds. Today over 35M USD locked in staking through our infrastructure across 8+ blockchains, more than 700 delegators use our services and trust our expertise. 

For our Tezos delegators we insured all rewards and have shorten the time before the first payout by 40% eliminating 5 cycle freeze for rewards. In addition, we achieved stable AAA+ rating on MyTezosBaker with over 100% baking efficiency according to [TezosNodes](https://www.tezos-nodes.com/) reaching the top 5 Tezos validators. We are proud to move towards being a robust staking partner and we will continue to do our best to maintain and further improve this level of quality.

To contribute the community building arround the projects we conducted the first meetup related to Cosmos ecosystem in Moscow featuring Cosmos Hub and Kava. Meetup attracted over 100 developers and enthusiasts showing the huge interest to the ecosystem. Another Moscow meetup related to Tezos and supported by [Tezos Commons](https://tezoscommons.org/) we co-organaized with [Baking Bad](https://baking-bad.org/). If you missed it you can watch the [recording of how it was](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4O5M30Exrg1abhacOJKUVw) with English subtitles.

We participated in incentivized testnets since the beginning and validate Cosmos Hub, IRIS Network, Terra Money, DAO BET, Cyberway, Kava, Kusama Network on mainnet since the first day. Overall uptime of our nodes across all networks is 99,98%. It is a good measurment of high availability and robustness of our setup. We haven't experience any downtime or double-sign slashing even in case of google cloud provider crash as we had set best class monitoring and alert systems working for convenience of our delegators 24/7.
