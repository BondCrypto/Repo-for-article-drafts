# How to choose an optimal staking strategy, part #1.

Previously we discussed why staking is important, how people interested in the network potential can benefit increasing their overall share without suffering from inflation implications. In this short blog post I want to cover some strategies, which participants could utilize with their outcomes and possible risks.

There are three key options for stakers in existing conditions:
Stake and forget
Stake and use the power of compounding in order to increase a total share of the network
Stake and save the current network share while withdrawing gains diluted by inflation from other participants who do not stake
In fact each of this options could be supplemented with the idea of diversification amongst various validators to decrease slashing risk.

For simplicity letâ€™s assume that we have two delegators, the first one is staking the second one not. Initial total supply is `100 atoms` inflation is `7%`, staking ratio is equal to target value of `67%` and considered period of observation is `5 years`. 

# 1) Stake and forget

This strategy may look convenient at a first glance but such behavior has many disadvantages. Not active delegator can miss the moment when a node goes offline for a long period resulting in slashing of a stake. Community may decide to change initial network parameters via governance. It may influence overall staking performance and not active delegator can miss that. In this case, accumulated rewards do not secure the cosmos hub.

Network share growth is slowing down as rewards become diluted by inflation and in following years it will become negative. Slashing will affect the whole holdings including rewards. 

# 2) Stake and compound

This strategy is especially effective when inflation is rising and exists strong belief in future ability of atom to capture transaction fees flow from validating on different chains, issuing assets and so on. In this case, additional gains from people who do not stake are re-delegated on an annual basis.

Staking ratio stays constant so return on staking (RoS) is not changing and network share growth is stable in this example and. Obviously rewards of this delegator outperformed the previous one. This strategy also has trade offs. If a big fish bonded to a single validator or validator itself has a big stake or delegated amount, implementing this approach may lead to high network centralization and power concentration. This will not benefit network participants and would undermine security of the cosmos hub. 

This scenario is also subject to slashing risk the most. To increase safety of the funds it is highly recommended to diversify stake amongst various validators even if slashing sounds like something unrealistic.

Ideal state of network decentralization may be defined as equal voting power percentage for every validator (of course, only if we assume that their validator security and costs of operating are equal). *In the described conditions every validator ideally maintain `1%` of the network share. Nowadays, top validators of cosmos hub have `>5%`. Does it mean that these validators are 5 times more secure?* Unfortunately, in real circumstances it is impossible and even if the voting power paritet exists, not every vote is equal. Some people may have more expertise and understanding of a particular system than others. 

Some validators decrease their voting power by delegating to small players leaving a place for them increasing their influence on the ecosystem development. It is a good intention, and bring opportunities to improve infrastructure. But, anyway, revenues of small validators become addicted until they become self sustainable. There is still no guarantee that they spend their funds in a targeted way. Validators with lower stake per delegator are more resilient(robust) and independent.

# 3) Stake and maintain the same share slightly releasing profit exceeding standard inflation

If `100%` of total atom supply is locked in staking every holder will have equal provisions. In fact, there would be no difference in their network ownership and no one would be diluted. In this case we cannot gain extra atoms and total yield would be zero. Inflation should be considered as a **feature that protects ownership of the network from dilution and as a punishment for every holder who does not contribute to the cosmos hub security**. Profit from inflation accrues only from those who do not stake. Their network share redistributes among others and there is always an option to withdraw this additions without ownership reduction.

This approach is also good as a hedge against slashing in a long run. The more frequently you withdraw and sell rewards the less atoms will be affected. This way of staking is especially effective if inflation and annual RoS are falling and network ownership growth is slowing down. Selling portions of atom provisions may be considered as a hedge against price fluctuations. If atom price is expected to decrease in a particular period released profits could be used to buy back with a better price. If price is expected to rise and future dynamic is uncertain then it could be a great cure against the greed and a good way to release profit without taking away the ability to generate revenue in future from asset and losing network ownership.
