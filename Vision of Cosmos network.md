Imagine the world where people living across continents can talk to each other without linguistic limitations. Humans would be able to communicate with maximum efficiency. Multinational teams would be able to interoperate and achieve synergetic effect. There are two possible scenarios that make it theoretically possible. 

The first one presumes an existence of a single global language adopted by everyone. In this case there are enormous (huge) difficulties (complications). National cultures across the continents are very different, generations have been creating(building) traditions and believes over the centuries. Each language results in (affects or influence) an individual mentality of each person. Existence of a single language means blurring the borders between nations and sounds unrealistic in our days.

Another way of thinking about it is to have a technology or device that automatically translates and transforms a speech and allows people speaking different languages understand each other without the need to learn a native language of a second person. With this idea, anyone could speak English in China an be understood. By the way, the first steps in this area were performed by Google. [Translatotron](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/introducing-translatotron-end-to-end.html) can serve as a starting point of a model that can directly translate speech from one language into speech in another.

# The vision of interoperable ecosystem for blockchains

In the blockchain space interoperability problem also exists as well as technology that can allow these blockchains to understand each other. Various blockchains serve various purposes and may be not suitable for some use cases. Ability to utilize features of each other and achieve synergetic effect may bring the new wave of development in crypto space.  

Cosmos ecosystem is a "place" where all networks are connected to each other through a set of standards called inter-chain standards (ICS). Communication is carried via inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) that requires specific modules that run on independent machines.  Specific blockchains called hubs play a role of translators and make it possible to perform state transfer including tokens, ID metadata or even validator's set. 

Construction of such application-specific blockchains from scratch is possible in a plug-in play manner. Cosmos SDK provides a framework for simplification of the development process and making it much more flexible. It is possible to choose from default modules that together define the actual state machine and customize sovereignty level. Each blockchain may have it's own set of rules, validators and governance procedure to experiment with various incentive models without the need to confront(conflict) with a single set of a governance rules. 

Freedom is a key to innovations. Innovations is a key to a breakthrough. Cosmos network creates a healthy environment for developers and entrepreneurs who is seeking new ways of  the value transition to the end user and offer new ways of cooperation by utilizing features of the whole set of projects in the ecosystem.
